# How did changing values on the SparkSession property parameters affect the throughput and latency of the data?

I measured the performance based on inputRowsPerSecond and processedRowsPerSecond.
throughput = processedRowsPerSecond
latency = processedRowsPerSecond-inputRowsPerSecond


# What were the 2-3 most efficient SparkSession property key/value pairs? Through testing multiple variations on values, how can you tell these were the most optimal?
